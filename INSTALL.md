# Installation

To get started make sure you have the dependencies installed on your computer
- Node.js
- npm

Next install docsify globally by running `npm i docsify-cli -g` in your terminal

`git clone` the repository and `git checkout gh-pages` to switch to the documentation branch

run `docsify serve ./` to start a local development server in [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)

Make changes to the documentation by adding more `.md` readme files to docs (make sure to update `layout/sidebar.md` so it shows in the sidebar).

`git commit` your changes and they should be live in [https://itp-xstory.github.io/p5js-shaders/](https://itp-xstory.github.io/p5js-shaders/#/)
