# Welcome to p5.js shader

Shaders are a great way to make graphics for your projects. So far you have probably made graphic shapes like **rect**() or **ellipse**() or maybe even 3D shapes like a **plane**() or a **box**(), and you should be more than familiar with using **fill**() to decide the color of these objects. But wouldn't it be great if we could make these objects have moving graphics on them? And without slowing down our sketch?

Enter the shader!

(IMG different examples of shaders on stuff in p5)

In this tutorial you will learn what a shader is, how to use it efficiently in p5, and how to make your own!

Consider this the "booklet of shaders". A great way to start familiarizing yourself with making amazing graphics for your projects in p5 and an introduction to shaders. 

If you find yourself entranced by the world of shaders (like we do) please see the section on moving further with shaders.
