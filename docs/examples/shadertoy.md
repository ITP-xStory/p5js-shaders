# Porting Shadertoy Code to p5.js Shaders

Shadertoy is an excellent resource for getting inspiration for your shader code.
Browsing through the examples you may see a noise function, for example, that would be useful in a sketch you're working on.
Shadertoy has some real master shader alchemists and we can become their apprentices by sifting through their formulas and equations,
just make sure however to give proper attribution and pay attention to any licensing specified by the author.
