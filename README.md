# Overview / to write

_The following is an overview of the Reference/tutorial we are writing for p5.js including a list of the examples that must be made. \
We are trying to bridge the gap for a programmer who just started programming (p5 community) to understand how to make shaders._

## Getting started with shaders using p5

Shaders are a great way to make graphics for your projects. So far you have probably made graphic shapes like **rect**() or **ellipse**() or maybe even 3D shapes like a **plane**() or a **box**(), and you should be more than familiar with using **fill**() to decide the color of these objects. But wouldn't it be great if we could make these objects have moving graphics on them? And without slowing down our sketch?

Enter the shader!

(IMG different examples of shaders on stuff in p5)


## What is a shader?

First of all, even though you may never have written a shader before you have definitely come across them! Every 3D object in every computer game ever has a shader attached to the it, the shader decides what color the object takes, but also how light bounces off the object, whether it is transparent and more. Also, if you have ever been to a concert where there were visuals which reacted to the sound or movements, these were likely shaders! 

A shader is a small program that runs entirely on your graphics card, the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), rather than the CPU (Central Processing Unit) of your computer. This makes it incredible fast.

While your CPU works by doing every calculation - every move of a pixel or shape you have been drawing until now - in sequence, meaning it takes each one and thinks about it, one a at time - your GPU is actually capable of something called parallel processing.

This means that everything you draw in your sketch by using a shader is drawn all at once, using the GPU! Therefor shaders are an incredible optimized way of making more complex drawings, without slowing your sketch down.

To understand what a shader does, imagine the CPU as a single pipe, where all of the pixels on your canvas must pass through, one at a time, to be told what color they should have. Now imagine instead, that each pixel has its own pipe, and we could just tell every pixels on your canvas what color it should have in parallel (at the same time). That is what a shader does. 

It is kind of like painting the Mona Lisa with a blast canon.
