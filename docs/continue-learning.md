# Check out these resources

There are some amazing resources on the web for learning more about shaders. 

#### **Resources for learning more:**

* [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com)
  * The book of shaders is an incredible online book with interactive examples, made by [Patricio Gonzalez Vivo](http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/) and [Jen Lowe](http://jenlowe.net/). It is by far the best place to start learning more about shaders, including the math and functions you can use when writing shaders.
  
* [p5.js Shader Examples](https://github.com/aferriss/p5jsShaderExamples)
  * "A collection of heavily commented WebGL shaders created with p5.js and GLSL", many of our examples were based off the examples that [Adam Ferriss](https://amf.fyi/) has here. He did a lot of ground work for us in figuring out how shaders work in p5.js and we recommend looking over his examples in conjunction with our guide.

* [Shaderific](http://www.shaderific.com/glsl)
  * A short, easy-to-read online reference for GLSL, built for the app "shaderific". 

* [WebGL Fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org/)
  * A long, easy-to-read online reference for WebGL.

* [OpenGL reference](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Main_Page)
  * The full wiki on openGL
